    "\n",
    "### Detailed Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. Create \"RAS-Commander Test\" subfolder in the same directory as this notebook, then extract \"BaldEagleMulti2D\"\n",
    "    2. List all project dataframes for the user's review\n",
    "    3. Existing Plan 06 uses Geometry 09.  Both of these will need to be cloned and the new plan will need to have the new geomery set as the active geometry\n",
    "    4. In the new plan and geometry, revise the Plan Name, ShortID and Description to denote that all roughness tables are increased by 0.01\n",
    "    5. Using the functions below, revise all base and region overrides in the new plan\n",
    "    6. Run both plans, parallel, 2 cores apiece\n",
    "    7. Using the point (2081626, 366459), find the nearest mesh cell and compare the results for the Template and Revised Plan.  Create a plot showing water surface elevation a the closest mesh cell. \n",
    "\n",
    "Work step by step through the notebook, including Markdown cells that explain each RAS-Commander function, its arguments, and how we are using it in our notebook.  Clearly explain the notebook's operation and show all work to maintain transparent operation.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Favor simple and concise code, and short segments of code that are easy to understand, to allow the user to observe each step.  \n",
