Jupyter Notebook is an incredibly versatile format that allows you to write, run, and test Python code in a clear, interactive way. It‚Äôs ideal for storing and running the scripts ChatGPT generates for you.\n",

This allows notebooks to be executed inside of the Integrated Development Environment (IDE).  Follow these steps to install:\n",

    "2. **Open Your Notebook**: Open the `.ipynb` file in VSCode. The file will automatically open in the Notebook interface.\n",
    "3. **Select a Kernel**: At the top right of the notebook interface, select the Python interpreter or kernel you want to use.\n",
    "4. **Run Cells**: Use the play button next to each cell or press `Shift + Enter` to execute the cell.\n",
