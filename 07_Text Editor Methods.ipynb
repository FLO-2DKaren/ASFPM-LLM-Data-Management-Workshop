    "# üîç Notepad++ Regular Expression (Regex) Codes\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "These regular expression patterns can be used in Notepad++'s Find and Replace dialog to perform complex text manipulations efficiently. Always ensure \"Regular expression\" is selected under \"Search Mode\" when using these patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objectives\n",
    "- Explore regular expression codes.\n",
    "- Learn to search by expressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regular expressions are powerful tools for searching and manipulating text. Here's a list of commonly used regex codes in Notepad++:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic Regex Codes\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`.` (Dot)**\n",
    "   - Matches any single character except newline characters.\n",
    "   - **Example**: `a.c` matches \"abc\", \"adc\", \"a c\", etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`^` (Caret)**\n",
    "   - Matches the start of a line.\n",
    "   - **Example**: `^Hello` finds \"Hello\" at the beginning of lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **`$` (Dollar)**\n",
    "   - Matches the end of a line.\n",
    "   - **Example**: `end$` finds \"end\" at the end of lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **`*` (Asterisk)**\n",
    "   - Matches zero or more of the preceding element.\n",
    "   - **Example**: `lo*` matches \"l\", \"lo\", \"loo\", etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **`+` (Plus)**\n",
    "   - Matches one or more of the preceding element.\n",
    "   - **Example**: `lo+` matches \"lo\", \"loo\", \"looo\", etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **`?` (Question Mark)**\n",
    "   - Makes the preceding character optional (matches zero or one occurrence).\n",
    "   - **Example**: `colou?r` matches \"color\" and \"colour\".\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **`[]` (Character Class)**\n",
    "   - Matches any single character contained within the brackets.\n",
    "   - **Example**: `[aeiou]` matches any vowel.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **`[^]` (Negated Character Class)**\n",
    "   - Matches any single character not contained within the brackets.\n",
    "   - **Example**: `[^aeiou]` matches any non-vowel.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **`{n}`**\n",
    "   - Matches exactly `n` occurrences of the preceding character.\n",
    "   - **Example**: `lo{2}` matches \"loo\".\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **`{n,}`**\n",
    "    - Matches `n` or more occurrences of the preceding element.\n",
    "    - **Example**: `lo{2,}` matches \"loo\", \"looo\", \"loooo\", etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. **`{n,m}`**\n",
    "    - Matches from `n` to `m` occurrences of the preceding character.\n",
    "    - **Example**: `lo{1,3}` matches \"lo\", \"loo\", \"looo\".\n",
    "\n",
    "12. **`\\` (Backslash)**\n",
    "    - Escapes a special character.\n",
    "    - **Example**: `\\.` matches a literal dot.\n",
    "\n",
    "13. **`|` (Pipe)**\n",
    "    - Acts as a logical OR.\n",
    "    - **Example**: `cat|dog` matches \"cat\" or \"dog\".\n",
    "\n",
    "14. **`()` (Grouping)**\n",
    "    - Groups multiple tokens together and creates a capture group for extracting a substring or using back-references.\n",
    "    - **Example**: `(abc)+` matches \"abc\", \"abcabc\", \"abcabcabc\", etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "15. **`\\1, \\2, ...` (Back-references)**\n",
    "    - Matches the same text as previously matched by a capturing group.\n",
    "    - **Example**: `(abc)\\1` matches \"abcabc\".\n",
    "\n",
    "16. **`\\s`**\n",
    "    - Matches any whitespace character (spaces, tabs, line breaks).\n",
    "    - **Example**: `\\s+` matches any sequence of whitespace.\n",
    "\n",
    "17. **`\\S`**\n",
    "    - Matches any non-whitespace character.\n",
    "    - **Example**: `\\S+` matches any sequence of non-whitespace characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "18. **`\\d`**\n",
    "    - Matches any digit (equivalent to `[0-9]`).\n",
    "    - **Example**: `\\d+` matches any sequence of digits.\n",
    "\n",
    "19. **`\\D`**\n",
    "    - Matches any non-digit.\n",
    "    - **Example**: `\\D+` matches any sequence of non-digit characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "20. **`\\w`**\n",
    "    - Matches any word character (letters, digits, or underscore).\n",
    "    - **Example**: `\\w+` matches any sequence of word characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "21. **`\\W`**\n",
    "    - Matches any non-word character.\n",
    "    - **Example**: `\\W+` matches any sequence of non-word characters.\n",
    "\n",

    "# üîç Comparing Files Using Python\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "Comparing data is a common requirement in many data analysis, and system administration tasks. This section will introduce you to basic techniques for comparing files using Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "- Understand how to use Python for file comparison.\n",
    "- Learn to compare text files line by line.\n",
    "- Explore methods to compare binary files.\n",
    "- Implement file comparison in practical programming scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tools and Libraries\n",
    "- **`filecmp` module**: A module that provides functions to compare files and directories in Python.\n",
    "- **`difflib` library**: Useful for identifying differences between sequences, including lines in text files.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Comparing Text Files\n",
    "To compare text files, you can read the files line by line and identify differences using the `difflib` library. This allows you to see exactly what has changed between the two files.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Getting a List of Files\n",
    "To build a list of files in a directory, follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Navigate to the Directory**: Open File Explorer and go to the desired directory.\n",
    "2. **Select All Files**: Press `CTRL + A` to select all files in the directory.\n",
    "3. **Copy as Path**: Hold `Shift`, right-click, and select \"Copy as path.\"\n",
    "4. This will be the list that you feed to ChatGPT.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you encounter issues with this process, you can ask ChatGPT to help build a list, even if the data is not on a single line.\n",
