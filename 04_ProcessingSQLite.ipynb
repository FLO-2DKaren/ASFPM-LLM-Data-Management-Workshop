    "# Exploring the GeoPackage Using the QGIS Browser Panel\n",
    "\n",
    "## Purpose\n",
    "The QGIS Browser Panel allows you to quickly explore the contents of a GeoPackage without adding the layers to the map canvas. This is useful when you want to inspect the structure of your data or explore different layers and tables without loading them fully into QGIS.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Open the Browser Panel**\n",
    "1. Launch **QGIS** on your computer.\n",
    "2. If the **Browser Panel** is not already visible, activate it by going to the menu:  \n",
    "   **View** > **Panels** > **Browser**.\n",
    "3. The Browser Panel will appear on the left side of your QGIS interface. This panel allows you to browse your file system and geospatial databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Navigate to the GeoPackage**\n",
    "1. In the **Browser Panel**, Right click the GeoPackage browser and create a New Connection.\n",
    "2. Navigate to the folder where your GeoPackage file (`.gpkg`) is stored.\n",
    "3. You can expand folders by clicking the small arrow next to the folder name.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/gpkg2.png\" alt=\"Geopackage Browser\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Explore the GeoPackage Contents**\n",
    "- Once you find your GeoPackage, click the small arrow next to it to expand its contents.\n",
    "- You will see a list of layers and tables stored in the GeoPackage.\n",
    "    - Vector layers (points, lines, polygons) will appear with different icons.\n",
    "    - Tables will appear with a simple table icon.\n",
    "- Find the `grid` and `infil_cells_green` tables.\n",
    "- Since the tables are sorted alphabetically, using the 'g' key will take you down to the first table that starts with 'g'.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/gpkg4.png\" alt=\"Geopackage Tables\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Explore the tables**\n",
    "1. Expand the `grid` and `infil_cells_green` tables to see the fields:\n",
    "2. Right click the tables to see editing tools.\n",
    "3. Open the Execute SQL... on the `infil_cells_green` table.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/gpkg3.png\" alt=\"Geopackage tools\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Drag and Drop Layers (Optional)**\n",
    "- Not all tales are visible when working with a FLO-2D project.\n",
    "- If you decide you want to work with a layer, you can drag and drop it from the Browser Panel directly onto the map canvas.\n",
    "- This gives you flexibility to choose which layers you want to work with while browsing the rest of the GeoPackage.\n",
    "- Remove the table when finished.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. **Close the GeoPackage**\n",
    "- When you're done exploring, you can close the GeoPackage by collapsing the folder or simply continue working with the data you're interested in.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to Use ChatGPT for Help\n",
    "1. **Ask for help browsing the GeoPackage**: If you're unsure how to find or explore layers, ask ChatGPT for guidance. For example, *\"How do I explore a GeoPackage in QGIS without loading the layers?\"*\n",
    "2. **Request more details on layers**: You can ask ChatGPT for more information about specific types of data in your GeoPackage. For example, *\"What does a vector layer icon mean in the QGIS Browser Panel?\"*\n"

    "# Update SQL tables\n",
    "\n",
    "## Purpose\n",
    "Geodatabase processing is more efficient that attribute table processing.  If you join data using a Table Join or Spatial Join, GIS software can be very slow and updating attribute tables can take several minutes to process.  SQL commands can perform the same task in a fraction of a second even with millions of records to update.\n",
    "\n",
    "This procedure updates the `hydc` field in the `infil_cells_green` table with values from the `elevation` field in the `grid` table using an SQL query. This is useful when you need to propagate data from one table to another inside a GeoPackage.  There are analogous tools for Geodatabase processing with ArcDesktop and ArcGISPro.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Examples of Operations\n",
    "- **SQL Update Query**: Modify a table of values using basic mathematical operations.\n",
    "- **Join the tables**: The operation joins the `grid` and `infil_cells_green` tables based on a common field (such as `grid_id` or another key).\n",
    "- **Clear delete Tables**: Specifically updates the `hydc` field in the `infil_cells_green` table with the corresponding `elevation` values from the `grid` table.\n",
    "- **Vaccume database**: Clear out empty table data after processing a SQL command or query.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Request a tailored SQL query**: Provide ChatGPT with the structure of your tables and the task you want to accomplish, and ask for a query that fits your specific need. For example, *\"Can you help me write an SQL query to update the `hydc` field in `infil_cells_green` with the `elevation` field from `grid`?\"*\n",
    "2. Be sure to include the fields that match so that the join is successful.  The `grid` table has an `fid` field that matches the `grid_fid` field from the `inifl_cells_green` table.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/gpkg1.png\" alt=\"execute sql\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Double-check field names**: If you're not sure about the field names or relationships between tables, ask ChatGPT to guide you through the process of inspecting your table structure. For example, *\"How do I check field names in an SQLite table?\"*\n",
    "5. **Verify the results**: After running the query, you can ask ChatGPT for tips on how to verify the updated data. For example, *\"What is the best way to verify that the `hydc` field was correctly updated in SQLite?\"*\n"

    "# Common SQL Operations for Tables\n",
    "\n",
    "## Purpose\n",
    "SQL provides powerful operations to manipulate and retrieve data from tables. Below are some common operations, including finding the maximum and minimum values, counting rows, summing data, and averaging values.  ChatGPT can build complex SQL queries if the data structure and names of tables and fields are known.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Examples of Operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Finding Maximum and Minimum Values**\n",
    "- **MAX()**: Retrieves the maximum value in a column.\n",
    "- **MIN()**: Retrieves the minimum value in a column.\n",

    "SELECT MAX(column_name) AS max_value, MIN(column_name) AS min_value\n",
    "FROM table_name;\n",
    "````\n",

    "\n",
    "### 2. Calculating the Sum of a Column\n",
    "- **SUM()**: Adds up all the values in a column.\n",

    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT SUM(column_name) AS total_value\n",
    "FROM table_name;\n",
    "````\n",
    "This will return the sum of all values in `column_name`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Calculating the Average of a Column\n",
    "- **AVG()**: Calculates the average value in a column.\n",

    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT AVG(column_name) AS average_value\n",
    "FROM table_name;\n",
    "````\n",
    "This will return the average of all values in `column_name`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Counting Rows in a Table\n",

    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_rows\n",
    "FROM table_name;\n",

    "# Python and SQLite - Advanced Module\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advanced Module requires QGIS and the FLO-2D Plugin**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Purpose\n",
    "When utilizing SQLite commands within QGIS, issues such as command hangs or non-execution may arise. For these instances, leveraging Python’s `sqlite3` module offers a robust and efficient alternative, particularly effective for updating grid element numbers in FLO-2D projects lacking specific user layers, such as Green Ampt User Layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example Overview\n",
    "In scenarios where a FLO-2D project is imported into QGIS using the import `*.DAT` files method, it is common for certain user layers to be absent. For instance, Green Ampt user data might be missing while schematic data remains accessible. There may be a requirement to expand the grid to cover a larger area while maintaining the existing Green Ampt parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "The schema table can be updated with new grid element numbers quite easily using SQLite and a Python script.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Preparing for Spatial Join**:\n",
    "    - Import the original `cadpts.dat` file and the new grid layer into QGIS.\n",
    "    - Use the **Vector > Data Management Tools > Join Attributes by Location** tool in QGIS to perform a spatial join between the `cadpts.dat` file and the new grid. Save this as `JT.shp`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Saving Joined Data**:\n",
    "    - Use the FLO-2D Plugin's geopackage management tools to export the `JT.shp` layer to the geopackage. Ensure the spatial data integrity is maintained during this process.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Reviewing Data**:\n",
    "    - Open the geopackage in DB Browser for SQLite or a similar tool to review the newly added `JT` table. Check for completeness and correctness of the spatial join.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Requesting Python Script for SQL Processing**:\n",
    "    - When complex SQL queries are required, such as updating the grid element identifiers in the geopackage, request assistance from ChatGPT. Describe the table structures and the desired operations in detail. For example, ask for help with a query like, *\"Can you help me craft an SQL query to update the `grid_fid` field in the `infil_cells_green` table with the `new_grid_fid` field from the `JT` table?\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Specifying Matching Fields**:\n",
    "    - Clearly define which fields are used to join tables. In this instance, ensure that the `old_grid_fid` field in the `JT` table aligns correctly with the `grid_fid` field in the `infil_cells_green` table. This ensures the join operation performs as expected.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important Note**: Always verify the presence and accuracy of data in your tables before executing any SQL queries. This practice helps prevent errors and ensures the integrity and reliability of your data management processes.\n"
