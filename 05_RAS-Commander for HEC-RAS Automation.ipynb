    "\n",
    "### Detailed Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. Create \"RAS-Commander Test\" subfolder in the same directory as this notebook, then extract \"BaldEagleMulti2D\"\n",
    "    2. List all project dataframes for the user's review\n",
    "    3. Existing Plan 06 uses Geometry 09.  Both of these will need to be cloned and the new plan will need to have the new geomery set as the active geometry\n",
    "    4. In the new plan and geometry, revise the Plan Name, ShortID and Description to denote that all roughness tables are increased by 0.01\n",
    "    5. Using the functions below, revise all base and region overrides in the new plan\n",
    "    6. Run both plans, parallel, 2 cores apiece\n",
    "    7. Using the point (2081626, 366459), find the nearest mesh cell and compare the results for the Template and Revised Plan.  Create a plot showing water surface elevation a the closest mesh cell. \n",
    "\n",
    "Work step by step through the notebook, including Markdown cells that explain each RAS-Commander function, its arguments, and how we are using it in our notebook.  Clearly explain the notebook's operation and show all work to maintain transparent operation.  \n",
    "\n",
