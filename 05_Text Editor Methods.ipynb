    "# Notepad++ Regular Expression (Regex) Codes\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "These regular expression patterns can be used in Notepad++'s Find and Replace dialog to perform complex text manipulations efficiently. Always ensure \"Regular expression\" is selected under \"Search Mode\" when using these patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objectives\n",
    "- Explore regular expression codes.\n",
    "- Learn to search by expressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regular expressions are powerful tools for searching and manipulating text. Here's a list of commonly used regex codes in Notepad++:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic Regex Codes\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`.` (Dot)**\n",
    "   - Matches any single character except newline characters.\n",
    "   - **Example**: `a.c` matches \"abc\", \"adc\", \"a c\", etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`^` (Caret)**\n",
    "   - Matches the start of a line.\n",
    "   - **Example**: `^Hello` finds \"Hello\" at the beginning of lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **`$` (Dollar)**\n",
    "   - Matches the end of a line.\n",
    "   - **Example**: `end$` finds \"end\" at the end of lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **`*` (Asterisk)**\n",
    "   - Matches zero or more of the preceding element.\n",
    "   - **Example**: `lo*` matches \"l\", \"lo\", \"loo\", etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **`+` (Plus)**\n",
    "   - Matches one or more of the preceding element.\n",
    "   - **Example**: `lo+` matches \"lo\", \"loo\", \"looo\", etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **`?` (Question Mark)**\n",
    "   - Makes the preceding character optional (matches zero or one occurrence).\n",
    "   - **Example**: `colou?r` matches \"color\" and \"colour\".\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **`[]` (Character Class)**\n",
    "   - Matches any single character contained within the brackets.\n",
    "   - **Example**: `[aeiou]` matches any vowel.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **`[^]` (Negated Character Class)**\n",
    "   - Matches any single character not contained within the brackets.\n",
    "   - **Example**: `[^aeiou]` matches any non-vowel.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **`{n}`**\n",
    "   - Matches exactly `n` occurrences of the preceding character.\n",
    "   - **Example**: `lo{2}` matches \"loo\".\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **`{n,}`**\n",
    "    - Matches `n` or more occurrences of the preceding element.\n",
    "    - **Example**: `lo{2,}` matches \"loo\", \"looo\", \"loooo\", etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. **`{n,m}`**\n",
    "    - Matches from `n` to `m` occurrences of the preceding character.\n",
    "    - **Example**: `lo{1,3}` matches \"lo\", \"loo\", \"looo\".\n",
    "\n",
    "12. **`\\` (Backslash)**\n",
    "    - Escapes a special character.\n",
    "    - **Example**: `\\.` matches a literal dot.\n",
    "\n",
    "13. **`|` (Pipe)**\n",
    "    - Acts as a logical OR.\n",
    "    - **Example**: `cat|dog` matches \"cat\" or \"dog\".\n",
    "\n",
    "14. **`()` (Grouping)**\n",
    "    - Groups multiple tokens together and creates a capture group for extracting a substring or using back-references.\n",
    "    - **Example**: `(abc)+` matches \"abc\", \"abcabc\", \"abcabcabc\", etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "15. **`\\1, \\2, ...` (Back-references)**\n",
    "    - Matches the same text as previously matched by a capturing group.\n",
    "    - **Example**: `(abc)\\1` matches \"abcabc\".\n",
    "\n",
    "16. **`\\s`**\n",
    "    - Matches any whitespace character (spaces, tabs, line breaks).\n",
    "    - **Example**: `\\s+` matches any sequence of whitespace.\n",
    "\n",
    "17. **`\\S`**\n",
    "    - Matches any non-whitespace character.\n",
    "    - **Example**: `\\S+` matches any sequence of non-whitespace characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "18. **`\\d`**\n",
    "    - Matches any digit (equivalent to `[0-9]`).\n",
    "    - **Example**: `\\d+` matches any sequence of digits.\n",
    "\n",
    "19. **`\\D`**\n",
    "    - Matches any non-digit.\n",
    "    - **Example**: `\\D+` matches any sequence of non-digit characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "20. **`\\w`**\n",
    "    - Matches any word character (letters, digits, or underscore).\n",
    "    - **Example**: `\\w+` matches any sequence of word characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "21. **`\\W`**\n",
    "    - Matches any non-word character.\n",
    "    - **Example**: `\\W+` matches any sequence of non-word characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use these patterns in Notepad++'s Find and Replace dialog by selecting \"Regular expression\" under \"Search Mode\".\n",
