    "In this class, we will use **Jupyter Notebook** as the interface between you and Python. Jupyter Notebook is an incredibly versatile tool that allows you to write, run, and test Python code in a clear, interactive way. It‚Äôs ideal for storing and running the scripts ChatGPT generates for you.\n",

    "- **Add cells** to write code and run it step by step.\n",
    "- **See results immediately**, making it easy to debug and tweak scripts.\n",
    "- **Document your work** with Markdown cells, allowing you to add explanations, notes, and instructions alongside the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How it works\n",
    "- **Code cells**: This is where you will enter and run your Python code.\n",
    "- **Markdown cells**: Here, you can add text, headers, or even embed images and links to provide context or explain the code.\n",
    "- **Execution**: Simply run each cell individually.  \n",
